# qtm

**This repository is deprecated**, its refactoring version now is [qsee](https://github.com/vutuanhai237/qsee)

qtm is the core module of quantum tomography and state preparation problems.

I make it an independent repository so that the tomography and state preparation repositories use the same core.
